                <p>Good Beans is run by a chatty American and a steady Norwegian. We were drawn first to a tiny shop in Amsterdam, and we stuck around to develop, deepen and spread a much bigger mission: making ethically-sourced coffee more approachable. Here’s a bit more about us.</p>
                <p>Cody runs our coffee programming and keeps our branding fresh. He is determined to spread the resilient energy and progressive vision of the origin partners behind your delicious morning cup. Reach out to him for brand collaborations or guest roasting opportunities. The stoic Norwegian, Harald is our operator. He handles all things finances, sales, and logistics. In other words, he keeps us marching, nay, cross-country skiing, towards peak efficiency. Reach out to him for order questions or wholesale enquiries.</p>

                <p>Our little shop is tucked just a bean’s throw away from the bustle of the Haarlemmerstraat, just north of the Jordaan. Good Beans is part-cafe, part-specialty bean shop, part-local art space, and part-living room, all packed into the ground floor of a cozy, old Amsterdam townhouse. Our door is open to any and all smiling faces and curious passers-by.</p>
                <p>Given the current circumstances, our little nook of cozy couch conversations has turned into a takeaway window. We have Fucking Strong Coffee running on our La Marzocco workhorse machine all day, in addition to organic chai, locally-blended tea, hot cocoa, and ginger beer. We showcase three or four Dutch micro-roasters at a time, with a rotating medley of fresh filter and espresso beans powering our growing group of home brewers who depend on us for the good stuff.</p>

                <p>When we started out as a specialty bean shop, we quickly noticed just how much plastic waste is generated by conventional coffee packaging. Every month, we were buying and selling dozens of single-use, difficult to recycle bags.</p>
                <p>Those same bags of coffee likely ended up in landfills or incinerators after their contents were brewed. Instead of adding to the problem, we found that cans offered a unique alternative. They are not only easier to recycle with other aluminum, but they’re sturdy and reusable. That means most of our cans live several lives as storage containers, bookshelf accessories, and cactus pots. Long live the can!</p>
